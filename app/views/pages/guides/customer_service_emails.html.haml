  %h1 How to write an excellent customer service email.

  %p Good customer service by email makes the difference between a brand that customers flock back to and a brand that customers forget. You may have a great product or service, but if your emails are helpful, brief, or provide poor service, you may be killing your business. Good customer service is paramount to building a good relationship with your customers.

  %h2 Automation.

  %p First, never send a customer a fully automated email and leave it at that. A fully automated reply should always include the information that a representative will actually be responding soon.

    Automating emails requires skill, so read

    on it. If you send an automated email that a human never checked over, what does your customer feel when the response is wrong? Frustrated? Dissatisfied? Regardless, they're not going to want to do more business with your company.

  %p Any machine-reply should be read over by a human before sending, to make sure it actually answers their question.

  %p However it's fine to send an email saying "We got your email and will respond soon. In the meantime perhaps your question is answered in our FAQ found at <URLHERE>."

  %h2 Be authentic.

  %p Your emails should reflect your brand and your values. Talk about the things your company sells in an excited way. You can always include promotions in your emails. Make customers excited to do business with you.

  %h2 Be clear and concise.

  %p Don't waffle around answering the actual question the customer had. The answer to their question should be no further in than the second paragraph of your email - or ideally the first thing they read. They want to know you really read their email and are replying as a human.

  %p Don't avoid providing information simply because it is unpleasant, as this will just make the customer experience worse.
